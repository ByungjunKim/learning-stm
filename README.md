# Structural Topic Modeling
This is a repository for my research using structural topic modeling, an approach for automated content analysis.

## What is a Structural Topic Model?
A Structural Topic Model is a general framework for topic modeling with document-level covariate information, which can improve inference and qualitative interpretability by affecting topical prevalence, topic content, or both. The [`stm`](http://www.structuraltopicmodel.com) R package implements the estimation algorithms for the model and includes tools for every stage of a standard workflow from reading in and processing raw text through making publication quality figures.
