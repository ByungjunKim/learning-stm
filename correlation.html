On that day, 241 U.S. Marines, soldiers, and sailors were murdered as they slept by truck bomb jihadists — who were waging a war on us long before we woke up and started fighting the war on them.  Barack Obama thinks they need more “compassion” and education. He wants to pull out and “end” the war, not win it.  A recipe, in other words, for more Beirut bombings.

From the 9/11 Commission report:  The Hijacking of United 175  United Airlines Flight 175 was scheduled to depart for Los Angeles at 8:00. Captain Victor Saracini and First Officer Michael Horrocks piloted the Boeing 767, which had seven flight attendants. Fifty-six passengers boarded the flight.40  United 175 pushed back from its gate at 7:58 and departed Logan Airport at 8:14. By 8:33, it had reached its assigned cruising altitude of 31,000 feet. The flight attendants would have begun their cabin service.41  The flight had taken off just as American 11 was being hijacked, and at 8:42 the United 175 flight crew completed their report on a “suspicious transmission” overheard from another plane (which turned out to have been Flight 11) just after takeoff. This was United 175’s last communication with the ground.42  The hijackers attacked sometime between 8:42 and 8:46.They used knives (as reported by two passengers and a flight attendant), Mace (reported by one passenger), and the threat of a bomb (reported by the same passenger). They stabbed members of the flight crew (reported by a flight attendant and one passenger). Both pilots had been killed (reported by one flight attendant).The eyewitness accounts came from calls made from the rear of the plane, from passengers originally seated further forward in the cabin, a sign that passengers and perhaps crew had been moved to the back of the aircraft. Given similarities to American 11 in hijacker seating and in eyewitness reports of tactics and weapons, as well as the contact between the presumed team leaders, Atta and Shehhi, we believe the tactics were similar on both flights.43  The first operational evidence that something was abnormal on United 175 came at 8:47, when the aircraft changed beacon codes twice within a minute. At 8:51, the flight deviated from its assigned altitude, and a minute later New York air traffic controllers began repeatedly and unsuccessfully trying to contact it.44  At 8:52, in Easton, Connecticut, a man named Lee Hanson received a phone call from his son Peter, a passenger on United 175. His son told him: “I think they’ve taken over the cockpit-An attendant has been stabbed- and someone else up front may have been killed. The plane is making strange moves. Call United Airlines-Tell them it’s Flight 175, Boston to LA.” Lee Hanson then called the Easton Police Department and relayed what he had heard.45  Also at 8:52, a male flight attendant called a United office in San Francisco, reaching Marc Policastro. The flight attendant reported that the flight had been hijacked, both pilots had been killed, a flight attendant had been stabbed, and the hijackers were probably flying the plane. The call lasted about two minutes, after which Policastro and a colleague tried unsuccessfully to contact the flight.46  At 8:58, the flight took a heading toward New York City.47  At 8:59, Flight 175 passenger Brian David Sweeney tried to call his wife, Julie. He left a message on their home answering machine that the plane had been hijacked. He then called his mother, Louise Sweeney, told her the flight had been hijacked, and added that the passengers were thinking about storming the cockpit to take control of the plane away from the hijackers.48  At 9:00, Lee Hanson received a second call from his son Peter:  At 9:03:11, United Airlines Flight 175 struck the South Tower of the World Trade Center.51 All on board, along with an unknown number of people in the tower, were killed instantly.   *** CREW  Capt.

As per usual, my list is arranged in no particular ranking order. So, gentlemen (and ladies)-start your DVD’s!This Sporting Life (1963) - This movie was part of the string of “angry young man” dramas that stormed out of the U.K. in the late 50s/early 60s. Films like Look Back in Anger, Saturday Night and Sunday Morning and The Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner were steeped in “kitchen sink” realism and youthful working class angst. This Sporting Life was an important watermark for both its director (Lindsay Anderson) and star (Richard Harris). Harris tears up the screen as a thuggish, egotistical young rugby player who has a gift for the game and subsequently becomes an overnight sports star. Criterion recently gave this one the deluxe treatment, including an excellent transfer.Personal Best - When this film was first released, there was so much fuss made over a couple of brief (and tastefully done) love scenes between Mariel Hemingway and co-star Patrice Donnelly that many failed to notice that it was probably one of the most realistic, non-condescending portraits of female athletes to ever reach movie screens. Writer-director Robert Towne did his homework; his pre-production research included spending some time closely observing Olympic track stars at work and at play. The women in his story are shown to be every bit as tough and competitive as their male counterparts; Hemingway and (real-life pentathlete) Donnelly deserve credit for not sugar-coating their characterizations in any way. Scott Glenn is excellent as the women’s hard driving coach.  Fat City- This 1972 character study is one of John Huston’s lesser-known works, but IMHO it is one of his finest. Stacey Keach (in the role of his career) is an alcoholic, down-and-out prizefighter who becomes a mentor for a neophyte boxer (Jeff Bridges). Susan Tyrrell is a real standout as Keach’s love interest (she received a Best Supporting Actress nomination for this role). I’ve always preferred this film to Rocky because there’s no sentimentality or audience pandering. The song “Help Me Make it Through the Night” haunts the film, and has never sounded so bittersweet. A downer, but well worth a peek.North Dallas Forty- Nick Nolte and Mac Davis lead a fantastic ensemble cast in this locker room peek at the lifestyles of pro football players and the machinations of team owners. Some of the antics are allegedly based on the real-life hijinx of the Dallas Cowboys, replete with wild parties and other assorted off-field debaucheries. Charles Durning (who scored a career achievement award from the Screen Actor’s Guild last Sunday) is perfect as the coach. Peter Gent adapted the screenplay from his original novel. This film is so entertaining that I can almost forgive director Ted Kotcheff for foisting Rambo: First Blood and Weekend at Bernie’s on us a bit later in his career…Slap Shot - A puckish satire. Paul Newman skates away with his role as the coach of a slumping minor league hockey team in this classic, directed by George Roy Hill. When Newman learns about a possible sale of the franchise, he decides to pull out all the stops and start playing \"dirty\". The entire acting ensemble is wonderful, and screenwriter Nancy Dowd’s riotously profane locker room dialog will have you rolling. Newman’s Cool Hand Luke co-star Strother Martin (as the team’s manager) handily steals all of his scenes. Lindsey Crouse is memorable as a sexually frustrated \"sports wife\" in a rare comedic role. Michael Ontkean performs the funniest \"striptease\" bit in the history of film, and the endearingly sociopathic “Hansen Brothers” have to be seen to be believed.Bull Durham- Writer-director Ron Shelton really knocked one out of the park with this very funny, insightfully written and splendidly acted rumination on life, love, and oh yeah-baseball. Kevin Costner gives one of his better performances as a seasoned, world-weary minor league catcher who reluctantly plays mentor to a somewhat dim hotshot rookie pitcher (Tim Robbins). Susan Sarandon is a poetry-spouting baseball groupie who selects one player every season to take under her wing and do some, er, special mentoring of her own. A complex love triangle ensues. It’s sort of Jules and Jim meets The Natural. I miss whip-smart, “adult” comedies like this-they are sadly MIA these days.Hoop Dreams – One of the most highly praised documentaries of all time, with good reason. Ostensibly “about” basketball, it is at its heart about perseverance, love, and family-which is probably why it struck such a chord with audiences as well as critics. Director Steve James follows the lives of two young men from the inner city for a five-year period, as they pursue their dreams of becoming professional basketball players. Just when you think you have the film pigeonholed, it takes off in unexpected directions, making for a much more riveting story than one might initially expect. A real winner. Bend It Like Beckham  – OK, so this is a shamelessly formulaic “feel good” flick-but only the most coldhearted cynics will be immune to its charms. Director Gurinder Chadha (she also co-wrote) whips up a cross-cultural masala that cleverly mixes the audience-pleasing elements of Rocky with some of the plot devices one finds in a typical  Bollywood romance. The story centers around a headstrong young woman (Parminder Nagra) who is upsetting her traditional Sikh parents by following her “silly” dream to become an English soccer star. Chadha also weaves in a subtle subtext on the difficulties that South Asian immigrants face while assimilating into British culture. Also with Keira Knightley and Jonathan Rhys-Meyers (who plays a likable character for once!)Downhill Racer – This frequently overlooked 1969 film from director Michael Ritchie examines the tightly-knit and highly competitive world of Olympic downhill skiing. Robert Redford is cast against type, and consequently delivers one of his more interesting performances as a talented but arrogant athlete who joins up with the U.S. Olympic ski team. Gene Hackman is outstanding (as always) as the coach who finds himself at frequent loggerheads with Redford’s contrarian demeanor (he makes John McEnroe seem like a lovable guy). The film has a cinema verite feel that gives the story a realistic edge.Death Race 2000 – At first glance, Paul Bartel’s film about a futuristic gladiatorial cross-country auto race in which drivers score extra points for running down pedestrians is an outrageous, gross-out cult comedy. It could also be viewed as a takeoff on Rollerball, as a broad political satire, or perhaps a wry comment on that great, timeless American tradition of watching televised bloodsport for entertainment (Super Bowl XLII, anyone?). One thing I’ll say about this movie-it’s never boring! The film was produced by the legendary king of no-budget cult movies, Roger Corman. It was written by Charles Griffith (a Corman veteran), who also penned the original Little Shop of Horrors and Bucket of Blood. David Carridine is a riot as the defending Death Race champ, “Frankenstein”. Also look for Bartel’s longtime leading lady Mary Woronov and a pre-Rocky Sylvester Stallone. If you were able to stomach Eating Raoul, you’ll love this one.And the Silver Medals go to (the next 10):Rocky Field of Dreams Raging Bull When We Were KingsBreaking AwayBody and Soul(1947)The NaturalThe Hustler The Longest Yard  (1974)Fear Strikes OutAnd the Bronze Medals go to (the next 10):Any Given Sunday HoosiersLagaan - Once Upon a Time in IndiaAll the MarblesMurderballWithout LimitsA League of Their OwnRunning CoolCaddyshackKansas City Bomber.Dennis Hartley 2/02/2008 06:04:00 PM LinktoComments('6702085201956686967')postCount('6702085201956686967');  | postCountTB('6702085201956686967');"],"thought_2":["Saturday Night At The MoviesSIFF-ting Through Celluloid: The Wrecking Crew & Sita Sings the BluesBy Dennis HartleyThe 2008 Seattle International Film Festival is in full swing, so I thought that for the next few posts I would take you along to some of this year’s screenings.Navigating a film festival is no easy task, even for a dedicated buff. This year’s SIFF is screening nearly 400 features and documentaries, over a period just shy of four weeks. It must be a wonderful opportunity for independently wealthy slackers, but for those of us who have to work for a living, it’s a little tough catching the North American premiere of that hot new documentary from Uzbekistan that is only screening once at 11:45am on a Tuesday. I’m lucky if I can catch a dozen films each year, but I do take consolation from my observation that the ratio of less-than-stellar (too many) to quality films (too few) at a film festival differs little from any Friday night crapshoot at the multiplex. The trick lies in developing a sixth sense for which titles “feel” like they would be up your alley (or, in my case, embracing your OCD and channeling it like a cinematic divining rod.)Some of the films I will be reviewing will hopefully be “coming to a theatre near you”  in the near future; on the other hand there may be a few that will only be accessible via DVD (the Netflix queue is our friend!). BTW, if you are lucky enough to go to Sundance, Toronto or Cannes, let’s get this out of the way now-Yes, I am quite aware that Seattle gets sloppy seconds from some of the more prestigious festivals; so go ahead, we’ll wait while you do your little “superior dance”. Okay, feel better? Good! Now let’s move on.The Wrecking Crew: Girls just wanna read charts.First up-a breezy and highly entertaining music biz documentary called The Wrecking Crew (not to be confused with the 1969 “Matt Helm” caper). “The Wrecking Crew” was a moniker given to a relatively small group of crack L.A. session players who in essence created the “sound” of classic American pop music that dominated the Top 40 radio charts from the late 50s through the mid 70s. With several notable exceptions (Glen Campbell, Leon Russell and Mac “Dr. John” Rebennack) their names remain obscure to the casual listener, even though the music they helped create is forever burned into our collective neurons.The film was a labor of love in every sense of the word for first-time director Denny Tedesco, whose late father was the  guitarist extraordinaire Tommy Tedesco, a premier member of the crew. Tedesco traces the origins of the aggregation, from its participation in helping to create the legendary “Wall of Sound” of the early 60s  (lorded over by mercurial pop savant Phil Spector) to collaborations with Brian Wilson (most notably, on the Beach Boys’ seminal “Pet Sounds” album) and backing sessions with just about any other  popular artist of the era you would care to mention (Sam Cooke, Ray Charles, The Righteous Brothers, Henry Mancini, Ike & Tina Turner, The Monkees, The Association, Nancy Sinatra, The Fifth Dimension, The Byrds, Sonny & Cher, The Mamas and the Papas, Frank Zappa, etc.). Not to mention a myriad of TV show themes.Tedesco features some incredibly cool vintage studio footage, as well as archival and present day interviews with key players. You also hear from some of the producers who utilized their talents (Herb Alpert, Brian Wilson and Jack Nitzsche). Tedesco assembled a group of surviving members to swap anecdotes (and as you can imagine, these guys have got some great stories to tell). One of my favorite reminiscences concerned the first recording sessions for The Monkees. An apparently uninformed Peter Tork showed up in the studio, guitar in hand-and was greeted by a roomful of bemused session players, giving him a “WTF are YOU doing here?!” look before he slunk away in embarrassment.One of the revelations in the film is bass player/guitarist Carol Kaye, a quietly unassuming pioneer who commanded a lot of respect in a traditionally male-dominated niche of the music industry. In a great scene, she modestly demonstrates a few signature bass lines that you may have heard, oh, once or twice; the opening riffs for “The Beat Goes On”, “California Girls”, the “Mission Impossible Theme”, even that subtle 5 note run that opens Glen Campbell’s “Witchita Lineman”  proves to be distinctively all hers.Judging from audience reaction, however, the star of the film is drummer Hal Blaine, who may very well be the most recorded drummer in the history of pop music. Blaine was at the screening I attended, and did a Q & A along with the director after the film. He told the audience that he is currently in the midst of compiling his discography (with the help of several researchers); he said so far they have been able to annotate “only” about 5,000 sessions (some estimates top the 10,000 mark). Blaine tells colorful and hilarious stories; he reminds me a lot of musician/comedian Pete Barbuti, who never failed to put me on the floor in his numerous appearances on The Tonight Show throughout the 70s.Tedesco’s film makes a perfect companion to the 2003 doc Standing In The Shadows of Motown.  That film profiled another group of unheralded session players (aka the “Funk Brothers”) who backed nearly every Motown hit. I know that there are some who look down their nose at this “lunch pail” approach to creating music, but there is no denying the chops that these players bring to the table, and I say more power to ‘em, myself. Tedesco’s film is a joyous celebration of a body of popular art that (love it or loathe it), literally provided the “soundtrack of our lives” for those of a (ahem) certain age.Sita Sings the Blues: Cry me a river Another film that looks to be an early audience favorite at SIFF this year is a wholly original animated musical called Sita Sings the Blues. This is the first full-length animated feature from cartoonist turned filmmaker Nina Paley, whose alt-comic strip “Nina’s Adventures” has appeared in the San Francisco Examiner and the L.A. Reader. She is now being called a “one-woman Pixar”, for producing this film on her home P.C.Paley cheekily adapts the Ramayana, an ancient and highly revered Sanskrit epic about the doomed love between Prince Rama (an incarnation of the god Vishnu) and the ever-devoted Sita. She juxtaposes it with a neurotic examination of her own failed marriage; the result is perhaps best described as Annie Hall meets Yellow Submarine  in Bollywood.Borrowing a device from the 1981 film Pennies From Heaven,  Paley literally “jazzes up” the tale with musical interludes featuring the long suffering Sita lip synching to scratchy recordings by 1920s vocal stylist Annette Henshaw.  Modern context is also provided by a parallel narrative concerning a present day yuppie couple living in NYC. The contemporary scenes are demarcated by a stylistic departure from the colorful computer generated animation that informs Sita’s story; Paley switches to a mix of stop-motion line drawings and rotoscoping. She also uses three narrators, who frequently (and hilariously) break through the fourth wall to debate with each other about the subtexts of the tale.Paley’s film is actually not the first animated adaptation of this story; Ramayana - The Legend of Prince Rama (a Japanese anime from 1992)  and Ramayana - Epic of Ram (an Indian production aimed at kids)  have preceded it. Keeping in mind that the original Ramayana is a 24,000 couplet epic poem, and that this is an 80 minute film with a Cliff’s Notes vibe, it obviously may not sit well with scholarly purists.

In a statement reported on Fox & Friends this morning, Team Obama deplores Ayers’ actions but rejects any connection between Ayers and Obama:That distance might be hard to maintain. First, the profile in the magazine wasn’t exactly a low-profile article in an obscure publication.  Ayers had just published a memoir of his days as a fugitive for domestic terrorism in the Weather Underground, and both the book and the publicity gained national attention, especially after 9/11.  Obama continued to work with Ayers after this, appearing on public panels with Ayers into 2002.If Team Obama wants to disassociate itself from Ayers in this manner, it should recheck its website.  Obama still defends William Ayers and his wife Bernadine Dohrn as part of Chicago’s “mainstream”.  Does Obama think that stomping on a flag in an alley to celebrate a memoir of domestic terrorism represents the mainstream of political thought?  That only makes sense when one supports demagoguery such as that issued by Jeremiah Wright on government conspiracies that created HIV as a genocidal tool and Dohrn’s exhortation to “overthrow capitalism” in the United States."],"thought_2":["Unlike Chris Matthews’ leg, I didn’t tingle upon hearing Barack Obama’s speech yesterday. My syndicated column today addresses his same old, same old talk.  What we call B.S. the MSM calls “bold.” What we call self-serving the NYTimes calls “eloquent.”  Thomas Sowell delivers straight talk: “There was no way that he didn’t know about Jeremiah Wright’s anti-American and racist diatribes from the pulpit.”  Milblogger Herschel Smith takes on Obama and the Sergeant Major of the Marine Corps.  There’s a black preacher I’ll never forget, a black preacher who lived racial reconciliation. Read about the Rev. Bennie Newton here.  More about Obama’s poor grandmother from Jim Hoft.  ***  Say goodbye to the Glowbama mystique Michelle Malkin Creators Syndicate 2008  Barack Obama—the self-anointed soul-fixing, nation-healing political Messiah—has lost his glow. That is the takeaway from the beleaguered Democrat presidential candidate’s “major” speech in Philadelphia yesterday.  For all of his supposedly unique and transcendent understanding of race in America, Obama’s talk amounted to the same old, same old. The Glowbama mystique has gone the way of the Emperor’s clothes. Instead of accountability, we got excuses. Instead of disavowal of demagoguery, we got whacked with the moral equivalence card. Instead of rejecting the Blame America mantra of left-wing black nationalism, we got more Blame Whitey. Same old, same old.  For two decades, Obama tethered himself to a fire-breathing pastor peddling bitter, Marxist “black liberation theology” in the name of God. Behind the “audacity of hope” was a grievance-mongering preacher animated by the voracity of hate. And understand this: The Reverend Jeremiah Wright and Barack Obama were not merely passing “associates.” They were mentor and mentee, guru and student, with fates and fortunes intertwined.   For two decades, while using the church to build his Chicago power base and credibility in the black community, Obama turned a deaf ear to Wright’s AIDS conspiracy theories, class warfare rants, anti-Israel, anti-white raves, and “God damn America” diatribes. These weren’t occasional outbursts. They were the bread and butter of the Trinity United Church of Christ. Now, Obama blames “talk show hosts and conservative commentators” for exposing Wright’s race-based rancor. Audacious, indeed.  On Friday, Obama attempted to minimize the extent to which he had been exposed to Wright’s poisonous politicking on the pulpit. “None of these statement were ones that I had heard myself personally in the pews,” he told Major Garrett of Fox News. “The other statements were ones that that I just heard about while we were — when they started being run on FOX and some of the other stations. And so they weren’t things that I was familiar with.”  Yesterday, Obama changed his tune: “I have already condemned, in unequivocal terms, the statements of Reverend Wright that have caused such controversy. For some, nagging questions remain. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Did I ever hear him make remarks that could be considered controversial while I sat in church? Yes.”   The clever Sen. Obama has attempted to erect a firewall of protection from probing questions about which remarks he heard and tolerated and failed to object to while sitting in the pews. Dwelling on what he knew and where and when, he argued yesterday, would be “to simplify and stereotype and amplify the negative to the point that it distorts reality.” But it is Obama’s pastor (“former” pastor, he is so quick to point out now, though he is a two-decade-long mentor) who holds a warped view of reality. And it is Obama who distorts the truth by likening this Ward Churchill of the United Church of Christ to an avuncular, yet lovable, family member who cannot easily be renounced:  “I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother – a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.” Glad to know something made Obama cringe.  Even as he denied that he was justifying and excusing Wright’s demagoguery, Obama was doing just that by invoking slavery, Jim Crow, segregated schools, violence in the inner city, and yes, denial of access to FHA mortgages, to explain how we get to Wright spewing “God damn America” on Sunday morning.  “These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love,” Obama declared rather stiffly as he stood self-consciously in front of more American flags that he has ever been placed in front of this campaign season.   Well, you can’t pick your grandma, but you can pick your pastor. And Obama picked the wrong one if he aspires to be the president of all America—an America that includes citizens of all colors who cringe at self-serving racial rationalizations masquerading as moral salvation."],"prob":["obama, wright, black, polit, barack, ayer, white"],"frex":["wright, jeremiah, reverend, dohrn, ayer, pfleger, sermon"],"lift":["afro-centr, afrocentr, againstand, agin, amerikkka, answeri, arroganceth"],"score":["wright, obama, ayer, jeremiah, church, pastor, racist"],"proportion":["0.04"]},{"name":["conserv, one, even, hes, like, point, question"],"children":[{"name":["exit, vis-avi, see-dubya, messiah, barri, itll, maverick"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[7],"thought_1":["A companion piece to his predictable whine this afternoon that it’s fearmongering to wonder whether a guy whose “judgment” seems always to lead to negotiation without precondition no matter how repulsive the actor is willing to use force if the situation requires.

Oddly enough, they’re willing to extrapolate from McCain’s “100 years” comment that he is and will be a crazed hawk in any and all situations; to conclude the opposite about the Messiah, that he’s a wilting peacenik who’ll sell the country away, is naturally the height of unfairness.

Five minutes of audio devoted to the Mohammed cartoons and the papist Crusade, a subject he already droned on about two years ago.

Too bad; if he’s going to revisit old jihadist grievances, I’d sure like to hear more of his take on global warming.Note that the tape is directed not at the U.S. but at the EU and conspicuously doesn’t mention Geert Wilders’s film, which is of a piece with the cartoons and has been in the news for at least a month.

After Perkins blasted the California Supreme Court for declaring that gay couples had a constitutional right to marry, Savage brought up the 1967 Supreme Court case, Loving v. Virginia, which found that interracial couples had a constitutional right to marry and struck down the bans that still existed in 16 states. Perkins declared it a “red herring” and said the issue of gay marriage was “totally different” than interracial marriage: PERKINS: If you want to change the law, instead of using the courts to redefine marriage. SAVAGE: So Loving v. Virginia, when the courts declared interracial marriage to be a constitutional right in the teeth of popular support, which was against interracial marriage at the time– PERKINS: Dan, you know that is a red herring. That is absolutely a red herring. SAVAGE: It is not a red herring. [...] PERKINS: You try to compare this to interracial marriage. It is not the same thing. There were extra provisions put that would prohibit people that were man and woman to marry. This is redefining marriage. It’s a totally different issue.  Watch it:  Gay marriage bans are strikingly similar to interracial marriage bans: Both seek to forbid someone from marrying someone else solely because of who that person is. Both are fundamentally discriminatory laws — one discriminates on the basis of race, while the other discriminates on the basis of gender and of sexual orientation. In fact, just last Sunday, Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger (R-CA) said gay marriage bans were “the same” as “when blacks and whites were not allowed to marry. This falls into the same category.”  Finally, Perkins flatly denied that young people voted against Prop. 8: “It’s not a majority,” he said. According to CNN exit polls, an overwhelming majority — 67 percent — of 18-29 year-olds voted against stripping gay couples of their right to marry."],"thought_2":["Christianists Are NOT Christiansby tristeroThere is a huge differene between Christians, the followers of a large number of separate, often mutually antagonistic, religions, and christianists, political radicals who use the symbols of Christianity in order to gain secular power. Christianists deliberately confuse the two. In these excerpts from a letter by Tony Perkins, the technique is quite clear. They highlight the importance for liberals of distinguishing religious discrimination - which is wrong - from the political marginialization of intolerant right wing hate groups and provocateurs - an essential action in a working democracy. In addition to confusing far right wing fanaticism with Christianity, note the gross distortions of reality and paranoid sense of victimization so typical of christianism:The stakes are enormous. We face a national menace to religious liberty:In Boston, a Christian adoption agency was shut down for refusing to place orphans with homosexual couples.The implication is that The Gay State proactively shut down the agency, who said,\"Thanks, but no thanks,\" to gay couples. Not true. I looked it up. Christianist Catholic Bishops chose to shut down Catholic Charities' adoption services.  - despite the unanimous support for same sex adoptions by CC's board:Eight members of Catholic Charities' board stepped down in protest of the bishops' stance. The 42-member board had voted unanimously in December to continue considering gay households for adoptions. And it clearly was a political decision by Catholic christianists, because Catholic Charities had, in fact, placed \"orphans\" with gay couples in the past:Social Services to provide special needs adoption services to children with severe emotional and physical needs since 1977. The contract expires June 30.In the past two decades, Catholic Charities has placed 720 children in adoptive homes, including 13 with same-sex couples. The bulk of adoptive children in Massachusetts are placed by DSS, rather than outside agencies such as Catholic Charities, the agency said.Next:In New Mexico, a Christian-owned studio was fined more than $6,000 for refusing to photograph a lesbian commitment ceremony. Not quite true.It was a christianist-owned studio. Furthermore, it was an anti-discrimination case. You can refuse to do any job you don't want to do, of course, but not  on the basis of race, creed, gender or sexual preference. If someone refused to photograph a Christian evangelical marriage because they were Christian evangelicals, the same laws would apply. You cannot discriminate. That is the law and it is a good law. It protects Christians as well as lesbians and it is sheer bizarroworld nonsense to flip this around and claim the law discriminates.Finally:In San Francisco, the city council officially condemned Christian opposition to homosexual adoption as hateful and discriminatory rhetoric.That's absolutely not true. The San Francisco city council condemned a specific, intolerant christianist organization that was organizing what was clearly a cultural/political hatefest that certainly is fair game for criticism or denunciation (as is any other group, including political parties and religions).Christianists are NOT Christians. More precisely, christianists may be Christians in their private life - or not, as the Jewish nut David Klinghoffer illustrates -  just as many christianists may have brown eyes. Their actual religious beliefs are an irrelevant identity to the political activity that uniquely characterizes christianism and makes it a non-religious group that uses the symbols of Christianity. tristero 9/24/2008 10:03:00 AM LinktoComments('8020055234183662180')postCount('8020055234183662180');  | postCountTB('8020055234183662180');"],"prob":["conserv, romney, immigr, huckabe, abort, eastern, right"],"frex":["huckabe, hage, huck, romney, evangel, rudi, giuliani"],"lift":["ahmanson, al-azhar, amnest, anti-cathol, anti-islam, beliefnet, brog"],"score":["romney, huckabe, huck, mitt, hage, immigr, gay"],"proportion":["0.03"]}],"topic_no":[7,8]}],"topic_no":[2,18,14,7,8]},{"name":["palin, holtz-eakin, biden, sarah, fiorina, mccain, r-az"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[17],"thought_1":["Potholders, Caribou, And Snow Machines: Greta’s Hard-Hitting Interview With Sarah Palin  \t\t\t\t\tAfter refusing interviews throughout her three-month campaign for Vice President, Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK) is now embarking on a “redemption tour,” throwing herself back into the public eye, including an interview with NBC’s Today show and a speech and press conference at this week’s Republican Governor’s Association meeting. Fox News’s Greta Van Susteren devoted two full nights to a backstage interview with Palin. It was Van Susteren’s second interview with Palin, not including her earlier trip to Alaska for a lengthy — and awkward — interview with the “First Dude,” Todd Palin. Greta’s new interview with Palin passed along such valuable nuggets as what to do when a mama moose attacks, how many caribou Palin has shot, and what household crafts the Palin children like best. Watch highlights of the two-night interview:  Palin also told Greta that she only asked for Todd’s opinion on whether to accept the VP slot at McCain’s suggestion. After McCain formally offered the job to her at his Sedona ranch, he had to remind Palin to consult her husband before agreeing: PALIN: Just looking right in my eyes and saying, Are you ready for this? Would you like to do this? And I said, I would be honored to run with you. Absolutely. [...] VAN SUSTEREN: Todd wasn’t with you. Did you call Todd then? PALIN: Well, before I said yes. That was Senator McCain’s recommendation. He says, Why don’t you call your husband and find out, you know, if he’s good with this also. I called Todd, and Todd, too, was no hesitation. He was like, Absolutely. This will be good. Yes, do this. And just good confirmation that, of course, we were to say yes."],"thought_2":["After Lobbying To Select Palin, Top McCain Adviser Can’t Bring Himself To Say She Was A Good Pick  \t\t\t\t\t In his recent New York Times Magazine piece on the McCain campaign, Robert Draper reveled that Sen. John McCain’s (R-AZ) pick of Gov. Sarah Palin (R-AK) “may have been even more impulsive than initially thought.”  Draper explained that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC) was strongly urging McCain to pick Sen. Joe Lieberman (I-CT). At the “last minute,” however, McCain strategist Steve Schmidt and campaign manager Rick Davis convinced McCain to pick Palin:  The evening of Aug. 24, Schmidt and Davis, after leaving the Ritz-Carlton meeting, showed up at McCain’s condominium in Phoenix. They informed McCain that in their view, Palin would be the best pick. “You never know where his head is,” Davis told me three weeks later. “He doesn’t betray a lot. He’s a great poker player. But he picked up the phone.” Reached at the Alaska State Fair, Palin listened as McCain for the first time discussed the possibility of selecting her as his running mate. Schmidt’s enthusiasm for Palin seems to have waned significantly in the last days of the election. Yesterday, reporters on the McCain campaign plane asked Schmidt if the campaign was “happy” with the Palin pick. Schmidt couldn’t bring himself to say “yes“: Q: And the pick of Palin for you guys? Are you happy with that? SCHMIDT: You know, we’ll uh, I’m not going to do, there’ll be time for all the postmortems in the race. Q: But are you happy with what she’s done for the ticket? SCHMIDT: I think that, you know, I think we’ll know in a few hours what the results are, you know and I, there’ll be a time for all the postmortem parts of it. That’s not this afternoon before the polls close.  Schmidt went so far last night as to “veto” Palin’s request to offer a few words to the crowd after McCain conceded the election. Politco’s Mike Allen reports on a forthcoming Newsweek article, “Palin asked to speak along with McCain at his Arizona concession speech Tuesday night, but campaign strategist Steve Schmidt vetoed the request.”"],"prob":["mccain, palin, john, campaign, said, obama, biden"],"frex":["palin, holtz-eakin, biden, sarah, fiorina, mccain, r-az"],"lift":["albrecht, back-bit, dhls, doggon, endspost-deb, fusillad, haymak"],"score":["mccain, palin, biden, sarah, obama, r-az, alaska"],"proportion":["0.06"]},{"name":["peopl, know, just, like, think, get, dont"],"children":[{"name":["oreilli, hanniti, matthew, editor, coverag, journalist, blogger"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[3],"thought_1":["O’Reilly Uses Doctored Photo Of NBC President  \t\t\t\t\tLast July, Fox and Friends aired doctored photos of New York Times reporter Jacques Steinberg and editor Steven Reddicliffe while attacking them for writing stories critical of Fox News. As Media Matters noted, “the journalists’ teeth had been yellowed, their facial features exaggerated, and portions of Reddicliffe’s hair moved further back on his head.” Some saw the photos as anti-Semitic. At the time, Bill O’Reilly laughed off the photo alterations: “Fox & Friends poked a little fun at Steinberg for misreporting the situation, as he does all the time, and they used an unflattering caricature of him.” He said Fox News had simply “made fun” of Steinberg — despite the fact that the Fox and Friends hosts did not explain that the photos were doctored when they aired them.  Now O’Reilly has added his own doctored image to the Fox repetoire, in a segment attacking NBC President Jeffery Zucker — apparently just for being the president of O’Reilly’s greatest rival:  The image is stretched to make Zucker look unflattering.

I see that Jane Hamsher got there first:MATTHEWS: OK. Who's going to break it to the blogosphere? They don't like anything that looks like a give to the right. Where are they going to be on this thing? Are they going to give him a break if he doesn't go hard left, if he doesn't do what they want?  Mr. WHITAKER: I think that Obama has to worry as much about the far left as he does about the far right. But, look, you know, I think that it could be a plus for him in some ways because I think they are going to give him what you might call Sister Souljah moments, when he can stand up to them.  MATTHEWS: Right.  Mr. WHITAKER: I've been talking to some veterans of those early Clinton wars who think that particularly this issue--the card check push by the labor unions to change the rules on organizing could be a moment for him, either by delaying that, standing up to the unions, of positioning himself more in the middle and making it harder for the far right to position him the way they tried to during the campaign.Jane and Pach both speak to this possible cave on the EFCA and what it means both politically and substantively. It seems like a poor way to repay the unions for their hard work during the campaign, but hey, the establishment has made it clear that the new administration must Sistah Soljah the left some way or risk being seen as being under their thumb. And there's nothing like  sticking it to the unions to make the political establishment happy.  (It's how you get airports named after you.)I know you'll all recall the pressure from the political establishment for George W. Bush to Sistah Soljah the right. Remember how they blew up at him when he said this:THE PRESIDENT: ...  Something refreshing about coming off an election, even more refreshing since we all got some sleep last night, but there's -- you go out and you make your case, and you tell the people this is what I intend to do.  And after hundreds of speeches and three debates and interviews and the whole process, where you keep basically saying the same thing over and over again, that when you win, there is a feeling that the people have spoken and embraced your point of view, and that's what I intend to tell the Congress, that I made it clear what I intend to do as the President, now let's work to -- and the people made it clear what they wanted, now let's work together.   And it's one of the wonderful -- it's like earning capital.  You asked, do I feel free.  Let me put it to you this way:  I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it.  It is my style.  That's what happened in the -- after the 2000 election, I earned some capital.  I've earned capital in this election -- and I'm going to spend it for what I told the people I'd spend it on...What, you don't recall the press insisting after both Bush elections that he needed to repudiate his most enthusiastic followers as often as possible to maintain his credibility?Oh wait.  Sorry.  I'm mistaken.  They didn't.  They just celebrated the fact that Real Americans had insisted that there would be no oral sex in the white house and that the president would throw strikes at Yankee stadium. Even after the Terry Schiavo circus, they didn't say anything about Sistah Soljahing the Republican base. (I suppose they couldn't --- after all, the Republican base are Real Americans unlike the crazy hippies on the left.)And then there's Matthews, the man who is sending serious signals that he wants to run for the Senate. As a Democrat. And I've heard some rather unfortunate rumblings that it's not a bad idea since he's really a liberal, he just couldn't show it during the decade he spent sucking up to Republicans on a daily basis for ratings.  Underneath it all, he's \"one of us.\" Perhaps the\" real \"Chris Matthews has emerged now that MSNBC has been made safe for progressives. Or, conversely, maybe the real Chris Matthews is actually an opportunistic, hypocritical jackass who should be shunned from any kind of Democratic politics for as long as he lives. Your mileage may vary depending upon whether you think enthusiastically sucking up to the GOP on television for the past decade is something that should be forgotten.I won't bother to write the book on Matthews again, but as one who has been chronicling his televised rhetorical atrocities for years,  let's just say his record speaks for itself.  The amount of damage he did, going all the way back to the Clinton years and up until just about five minutes ago is considerable.  He is as unacceptable as a Democratic high official as Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity, perhaps less so because of the fact that he is, by all accounts, a whore who has made millions of dollars a year destroying Democrats, while privately assuring his  friends and associates that he doesn't really mean it. At least Rush plays for his own team with everything he's got.Seriously, this guy is a clown who will make the Democratic Party in Pennsylvania into a laughing stock.  Darrell Hammond alone will kill him if Youtube doesn't. It's an insane idea. If you like liberals like Joe Lieberman, you'll love Chris Matthews.The fact that this is being discussed seriously makes me wonder if there's anybody who has repeatedly and enthusiastically  fucked the Democratic party over the past 20 years or so to whom the party leadership aren't giving political amnesty?  It would be nice to know so that I don't waste my breath defending them anymore only to be made a fool of when their tormentors are welcomed into the party as if it never happened. (I'm not a willing Omega.)Punishing your allies while rewarding your enemies is a very unusual strategy, but it seems to be the one the village has set forth as being Obama's best chance of success.  It's risky.

When the next Dem president does anything for the poor, the same ’90s-wingnut Contract On America themes will recycle (which were recycled from Reaganite bullshit, itself recycled Goldwater rhetoric, which itself was recycled from 1930s anti-New Deal screeds, which were in turn recycled from anti-Progessive propaganda; you see the lack of imagination at work here — as St. Barry of Arizona said, his ideas were old). If the next Dem president does anything about the Israel-Palestine issue or stops American warmongering in the Middle East, the same late-’70s ZOMG-Jimmy-Carter-is-Neville-Chamberlain bullshit will recycle. Wingnuts regurgitate their arguments, and hope that if they do it enough, then what’s demonstrably false in them will be perceived as plausibly true. Wishing this phenomenon away won’t stop it. The only thing to do is to remember why these arguments were wrong in the first place.           Read the whole post.  One of the main political lessons  liberals continuously fail to absorb is that none of this is new, the world wasn't created yesterday --- and human nature is pretty predictable. Conservative argument keeps coming back, again and again and they succeed because liberals always want to \"turn the page\" and \"let bygones be bygones\" so we can \"get things done.\" It doesn't work.  They repeat these things like a mantra and they take on the patina of \"truth\" because well, everybody keeps saying it, it sounds familiar, it's always \"out there.\"  If liberals would resist the urge to forget everything they've learned about the right every few years they might be able to sustain the counterargument and have that take on the patina of truth.

Among those senior advisers who objected to the ad's negative content was senior ad guru Mandy Grunwald, who's clashed with Penn in the past, the source says.   Just after Hillary's Ohio and Texas wins, Penn  credited the actual ad, which contained no direct hit on Obama, with breaking his momentum.  But the version that did this -- to the extent that the ad worked -- was a later, and more positive spot, than one initially proposed by Penn, the source says.  \"This was the way it was originally conceived,\" the adviser says. \"It did not say the words `Barack Obama.' But there was a contrast part. It had a clear hit on Obama and it also had a much more negative feeling with the music.\"  The adviser continues: \"The original ad asked, Who would you prefer answering the call -- someone with strength and experience, or someone who's untested?\"   The clash over the ad underscores yet again the extent to which Penn clashed with other senior Hillary advisers about the campaign's message and direction. Some Hillary advisers hope that Penn's departure will signal less reliance on heavy-handed assertions about Obama's supposed weakness in comparison with Hillary and more of an emphasis on humanizing Hillary and showcasing her leadership abilities.  The disagreement over the ad also undercuts Penn's own justification for the ad. Shortly after news of the ad broke, Penn  described the ad during a conference call with reporters as \"a positive spot\" with \"very soft images.\"  The Hillary campaign and Penn's office both declined to comment on the clash over the ad; Grunwald didn't return repeated calls."],"thought_2":["More infighting in Camp Hillary?

Intergovernment Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) study had concluded:  In one of the report’s most worrisome findings, the agency estimates that in light of recent ice sheet melting, global sea levels could rise as much as 4 feet by 2100.

The Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets are losing an average of 48 cubic miles of ice a year, equivalent to twice the amount of ice in the Alps. The lead scientist for the report’s chapter on ice sheets said the models used by the IPCC “did not factor in some of the dynamics that scientists now understand about ice sheet melting” such as “a process of ‘lubrication,’ in which warmer ocean water gets underneath coastal ice sheets and accelerates melting.”           \t  Update The Wonk Room's Brad Johnson has more on ice sheet melting."],"thought_2":["NASA has confirmed that a developing natural climate pattern will likely result in much colder temperatures.  Of course, the climate alarmists' favorite dubious data source was also quick to point out that such natural phenomena should not confuse the issue of manmade greenhouse gas induced global warming.According to NASA's Earth Observatory, where you'll also find satellite images and detailed explanations of the event:\"A cool-water anomaly known as La Niña occupied the tropical Pacific Ocean throughout 2007 and early 2008.

Its name comes from verses 50-60, which tell the story of the prophet Hud, who was according to Islamic tradition sent to the ‘Ad people of Arabia around 2400 BC. Sura 11 repeats in stronger terms the warnings of sura 10 concerning Allah’s judgment. That, according to a hadith, caused Muhammad anxiety. Once one of his leading followers, Abu Bakr, said to him, “O Messenger of Allah, verily your hair has turned gray.” Muhammad replied that Sura 11, along with suras 56, 77, 78, and 81, all of which deal with judgment day, “have turned my hair gray.” This hair-graying sura begins (verses 1-24) with a recapitulation of many themes touched on in sura 10, including the wisdom of the Qur’an itself (v. 1). Mujahid, Qatadah, and Ibn Jarir, among others, explained this verse as meaning that the Qur’an is “perfect in its wording, detailed in its meaning. Thus, it is complete in its form and its meaning.” For, says Ibn Kathir, “this Qur’an descended, perfect and detailed, with the purpose of Allah’s worship alone, without any partners.” The Qur’an is also inimitable: the challenge to produce a sura like it is repeated in v. 13. Stressed: the necessity to worship only Allah (v. 2) and the dependence of all creatures upon him (v. 6); the worthlessness of idols (v. 14); the deceptive glamour of this life (v. 15); the dreadful punishment (vv. 16, 22) that awaits those who “invent a lie against Allah” (v. 18), and the delightful gardens that await the blessed (v. 23).Verse 5 contains a strange statement: “At the very moment when they cover themselves with their clothing, Allah knows that which they keep hidden and that which they proclaim.” What would covering themselves with clothing have to do with Allah knowing them? Well, it appears that some people wore clothes to conceal themselves from Allah, particularly during intimate moments: Ibn Abbas explains that “there were people who used to be shy to remove their clothes while answering the call of nature in an open space and thus be naked exposed to the sky. They were also ashamed of having sexual relations with their women due to fear of being exposed towards the sky. Thus, this was revealed concerning them.”Then follow the stories of various prophets, all revolving around their rejection by perverse and obstinate unbelievers. Verses 25-49 tell the story of Noah and the ark, with a significant difference from the Biblical story. In Genesis 6-9, Noah has nothing to do with the unbelievers at all; God tells him, “I have determined to make an end of all flesh; for the earth is filled with violence through them; behold, I will destroy them with the earth” (Genesis 6:13), and tells him to build the ark, but he doesn’t tell him to go warn the people about the flood. But in the Qur’an, Noah comes to his people with a “clear warning” (v. 25) that they should “serve none but Allah” (v. 26). So the corruption and violence of which the people are guilty in the Biblical account in the Qur’an become simply idolatry, or more precisely, shirk, the association of partners with Allah. Of course, Muhammad came to his people with a clear warning (14:52) that they should serve none but Allah (3:64), and so in this account Noah is kind of a proto-Muhammad, preaching a message identical to his. And that is, indeed, how Islam views all the Biblical prophets. They, like Muhammad, taught Islam – it was their followers who corrupted their teachings to create modern Judaism and Christianity. Even the reception Noah receives resembles how the pagan Quraysh received Muhammad. The unbelievers tell him he is just a man and charge him and his followers with lying (v. 27), and even claim he is forging the messages he claims are from Allah (v. 35). Noah counters by saying that it won’t matter what he says to them if Allah has determined to lead them astray (v. 34). This, of course, almost exactly replicates Muhammad’s experience: Allah tells him to tell the unbelievers that he is just a man (18:110); they charge him with lying (42:24) and with forging the Qur’an (v. 13); and of course Muhammad also teaches that if Allah wills to lead someone astray, no one can guide him (7:186).Noah is, then, essentially a stand-in for Muhammad. Indirectly emphasized are the identity of the messages of all the prophets, and the obstinacy of the unbelievers before the manifest truth of Allah. One of those unbelievers is Noah’s son, who declines to enter the ark and instead says, “I will betake myself to some mountain: it will save me from the water” (v. 43). His son dies in flood, and Noah reminds Allah of his promise to save his family (which came in v. 40): “O my Lord! Surely my son is of my family!” (v. 45). But Allah tells him, “O Noah! He is not of thy family: for his conduct is unrighteous” (v. 46). Belief and unbelief in Islam supersede even family ties. Ibn Kathir explains: “Thus, for his son, it had already been decreed that he would be drowned due to his disbelief and his opposition to his father.”The story of Hud (verses 50-60) follows a roughly similar pattern. He tells the people of ‘Ad to repent (v. 52), but they complain that he has brought them no clear sign (v. 53), and are destroyed – although Hud and his people are saved (v. 58). Verses 61-68 repeat the same pattern in telling the story of Salih, who was sent sometime after Noah’s time to the Thamud people, who lived in northern Arabia. Allah gives them a sign of his power: the “she-camel of Allah is a symbol to you” (v. 64) – which according to some traditions emerged miraculously from a mountain. The Thamud are told not to harm it, but they do anyway (v. 65) and are destroyed (v. 67), except for Salih and the believers (v. 66). Verses 69-83 retell the Biblical story of Abraham, Sarah and Lot, culminating in the destruction of an unnamed Sodom and Gomorrah (v. 82) with a strong hint of an unnamed crime of sodomy (v. 79). Verses 83-95 tell the story of Shu’aib, prophet to the Midianites, in language very similar, and with an identical outcome, to the story of Hud.Then verses 96-123 recapitulate many themes of the entire sura, with passing reference to Moses and Pharaoh (vv. 96-98). Both those who reject Allah and those who accept him will face a fearsome judgment, leading to hellfire for the unbelievers and Paradise for the believers (vv. 103-108). Allah gave Moses the Torah, but there are disputes about it (v. 110), which Allah would have already settled except that he has decided to “delay His chastisement from your nation,” according to the Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâs. The believers should pray and be steadfast (vv. 114-115), for all this is Allah’s will: “If thy Lord had so willed, He could have made mankind one people: but they will not cease to dispute” (v. 118). Yet believers must trust in him (v. 123).Next week: Sura 12, “Joseph”: signs and symbols for seekers after truth.(Here you can find links to all the earlier “Blogging the Qur’an” segments. Here is a good Arabic/English Qur’an, here are two popular Muslim translations, those of Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall, along with a third by M. H. Shakir. Here is another popular translation, that of Muhammad Asad. And here is an omnibus of ten Qur’an translations.)"],"thought_2":["This sura dates, like suras 6, 7, 10, 11, and 12, from late in the Meccan period, the first period of Muhammad’s career as a prophet. Its name comes a phrase in v. 13, “the thunder repeats his praises.” Its main theme is summed up by v. 1, in which Allah tells Muhammad, “These are the signs” — ayat, verses – “of the Book: that which hath been revealed unto thee from thy Lord is the Truth; but most men believe not.” Ibn Kathir sees the four Arabic letters that begin this chapter, and similar unexplained letters beginning many suras of the Qur’an, as confirmation of its miraculous character: “Every Surah that starts with separate letters affirms that the Qur’an is miraculous and is an evidence that it is a revelation from Allah, and that there is no doubt or denying in this fact.” Despite the mystery of these letters, however, he goes on to assert that the Qur’an is “clear, plain and unequivocal,” and that “most men will still not believe, due to their rebellion, stubbornness and hypocrisy.” The Tafsir al-Jalalayn and the Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâs say that the “most people” who will not believe according to v. 1 are the people of Mecca.In what should they believe? Verses 2-19 emphasize Allah’s power in all things. Allah “raised the heavens without any pillars that ye can see” (v. 2) – a physical image that Ibn Kathir expands upon in a physical way: “The distance between the first heaven and the earth is five hundred years from every direction, and its thickness is also five hundred years. The second heaven surrounds the first heaven from every direction, encompassing everything that the latter carries, with a thickness also of five hundred years and a distance between them of five hundred years.” This is not to say that Islam envisions a physical Allah – the Allah whom “no vision can grasp” (6:103) and who is “nearer than the jugular vein” (50:16) is not physical, but this is the subject of some Sunni-Shi’ite polemics. Some argue that even though Allah is nearer than the jugular vein, he is not everywhere. Some modern Muslims argue that to affirm otherwise would be to fall into pantheism and shirk: the association of partners with Allah, the cardinal sin in Islam. They argue this from the fact that Allah has “mounted the Throne” (v. 2; also 7:54). The Imam Abul Hasan al-Ash’ari (874-936) argued against the claim of the rationalist-minded Mu’tazilite sect that this verse meant that Allah was everywhere. “If it were as they asserted,” he asked, “then what difference would there be between the Throne and the earth?” And the tenth century scholar of hadith Ibn Khuzaymah declared: “Whoever does not affirm that Allah is above His heavens, upon His Throne and that He is distinct from His creation; must be forced to repent. If he does not repent, then he must be beheaded and then thrown into a garbage dump, so that the Muslims and the Ahl-Dhimma (the Christians and the Jew) will not suffer from his stinking smell.”In all of creation are “signs for those who consider” (v. 3). Verses 2-4, 8-13, and 16-17 see his power in creation: the sun and moon are subject to him (v. 2, a verse to ponder for those who equate Allah with the moon god); he sees all things (vv. 8-9); he shows mankind “the lightning, by way both of fear and of hope” (v. 13). But the unbelievers, perverse as ever, ask Muhammad  “to hasten on the evil in preference to the good” (v. 6) – that is, they ask him in derision to bring divine chastisements upon them, according to the Tanwîr al-Miqbâs min Tafsîr Ibn ‘Abbâs, and demand miracles (v. 7). Each believer, meanwhile is guarded by angels (v. 11). Ibn Kathir says that there are four: two guards, one in back and one in front, and two who record the Muslim’s good and bad deeds. The believer greets the recording angels during prayer, turning to his right and left shoulder and saying each time, “Peace be upon you.”The same verse suggests that people really do have free will: “Allah does not change a people’s lot unless they change what is in their hearts” (v. 11). The Tafsir al-Jalalayn explains: “He does not deprive them of His grace — unless they have altered the state of their souls, from [their] comely nature, through an act of disobedience.” Yet it is hard to see how this fits in with the idea that “had Allah willed, He could have guided all mankind” (v. 31); “those whom Allah leaves to stray, no one can guide” (v. 33); and other passages that state that one’s belief or unbelief is up to Allah (10:99-100). In Islamic history the idea of free will was early on declared heretical. The twelfth-century Hanbali jurist Ibn Abi Ya’la describes the Qadari sect, which affirmed free will: “They are those who claim that they possess in full the capacity to act (al-istitâ`a), free will (al-mashî’a), and effective power (al-qudra). They consider that they hold in their grasp the ability to do good and evil, avoid harm and obtain benefit, obey and disobey, and be guided or misguided. They claim that human beings retain full initiative, without any prior status within the will of Allâh for their acts, nor even in His knowledge of them. Their doctrine is similar to that of Zoroastrians and Christians. It is the very root of heresy.”Verses 20-43 repeat familiar themes: the righteous will enter Paradise (vv. 20-24, 35); those who break Allah’s covenant are accursed (v. 25); the unbelievers demand a sign (v. 27) and will be punished in this world and the next (v. 34); the unbelievers ascribe partners to Allah (v. 33) and reject part of the Qur’an (v. 36), while the believers do the opposite. V. 31, with its reference to “a Qur’an with which mountains were moved, or the earth were cloven asunder, or the dead were made to speak,” refers to the unbelievers’ demand for a miracle. The Tafsir al-Jalalayn explains that it was “revealed when they said to him, ‘If you are [truly] a prophet, then make these mountains of Mecca drift away before us, and make for us rivers and springs in it, that we may plant and sow seeds, and resurrect for us our dead fathers to speak to us and tell us that you are a prophet.” But even if those things happened, they still wouldn’t believe. The Tafsir al-Jalalayn says that the phrase “Allah doth blot out or confirm what He pleaseth: with Him is the Mother of the Book” (v. 39) refers to the Qur’an: “God effaces, of it [the Book], whatever He will and He fixes therein whatever He will of rulings or other matters, and with Him is the Mother of the Book, its [source of] origin, of which nothing is ever changed, and which consists of what He inscribed in pre-eternity (azal).” This remains the orthodox view of the Qur’an: that it is a perfect, unchanging copy of the Mother of the Book that has existed forever with Allah.Next week: Sura 14, “Abraham”: “And you will see the sinners that day bound together in fetters; their garments of liquid pitch, and their faces covered with Fire.” (Here you can find links to all the earlier “Blogging the Qur’an” segments. Here is a good Arabic/English Qur’an, here are two popular Muslim translations, those of Abdullah Yusuf Ali and Mohammed Marmaduke Pickthall, along with a third by M. H. Shakir.

Steve Gilbert has unearthed a report from over 5 years ago from the National Legal and Policy Center that includes some interesting information:Roland Burris having been a character witness for a Teamster expelled from office for associating with organized crime....Last January, the \"in-house judge\" of the Laborers' Intl. Union of N. Amer. permanently barred three relatives from holding office in Local 1001. Based on the testimony of law enforcement officials, frmr. mob associates, and informants under witness protection, Peter F. Vaira concluded that Bruno Caruso, his brother, Frank \"Toots\", and their first cousin, Leo, had been associates of the mafia, known in Chicago as the \"Outfit,\" for more than 40 years. .......on Jan. 17, Local bosses met with an unnamed \"national union official\" and \"agreed to enter into a voluntary supervision agreement  if Burris is appointed to that role.\" This is not Burris's first involvement with allegedly corrupt unions. While serving as attny. gen. in 1994, Burris was a character witness for Robert T. Simpson Jr., frmr. pres. of Intl. Bhd. of Teamsters (IBT) Local 743. In spite of that testimony, the fed. Independent Rev. Bd. (IRB) ruled that Simpson had allowed Donald Peters to continue his influence of the Chicago local after Peters had agreed to have nothing to do with the union. Peters was named as a defendant in the 1988 fed. racketeering lawsuit against the IBT. (Emphasis by Steve Gilbert) To be fair, there's nothing illegal here. All this shows is that he made his living in the sewer of Chicago politics.

Blagojevich, upset with editorials that were critical of his actions, allegedly  hatched a plan to get editorial writers fired. In November, Blagojevich and  Harris reached out to Larsen, identified in court records as \"Tribune Financial  Adviser.\"According to the criminal complaint, Blagojevich instructed  Harris to tell Larsen changes needed to be made to the editorial board or the  governor would block money for Wrigley Field  renovations.Larsen is Zell's point man on efforts to sell the Chicago  Cubs. Tribune Co. owns the Cubs and the newspaper.Court documents  portray Blagojevich as eager to exploit Tribune Co.'s financial  problems.Tribune Co. has been in discussions with the state over the  sale of Wrigley Field, which could mean as much as $100 million for the company.  Zell has sought to sell the Cubs and use the proceeds to pay down debt  associated with his takeover of Tribune Co., which filed for bankruptcy  protection this week.Blagojevich suggested his aides take the issue  head-on and that someone might want to talk directly to Zell.Whether  Larsen ever attempted to apply pressure to Tribune officials remained  unclear.The Trib has received a subpoena asking for “memos about potential staff cuts or changes to the Chicago Tribune editorial board,” according to one source. The cowardly Zell, who was seeking a $150 million capital gains tax abatement from the IL Finance Authority, may have agreed to the extortion according to a phone call between Blago staff chief John Harris and the governor on November 21 that was taped by the Feds."],"prob":["polit, campaign, report, state, money, group, investig"],"frex":["blagojevich, fitzgerald, blago, rezko, donat, donor, spitzer"],"lift":["-apr-, -feb-, -mar-, -market-r, -may-, -us, abdon"],"score":["blagojevich, rezko, acorn, blago, chicago, investig, donor"],"proportion":["0.05"]}],"topic_no":[1,19]}],"topic_no":[6,15,10,1,19]}],"topic_no":[4,20,6,15,10,1,19]}],"topic_no":[2,18,14,7,8,17,3,12,4,20,6,15,10,1,19]},{"name":["world, countri, america, will, american, presid, nation"],"children":[{"name":["putin, gaza, ossetia, hama, russian, iaea, hezballah"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[9],"thought_1":["Iran's nauseating, Nazi-inspired rhetoric over the last few days could presage an attack on Israel or Israeli citizens around the world.Some experts are also pointing to this uptick in name calling as a way to deflect attention from what is sure to be another ambiguous report by the IAEA on Iran's nuclear program:Top Iranian officials have increased their verbal attacks and threats against Israel in recent days, in a pattern seen by Iran-watchers in Jerusalem as a possible precursor of a terrorist attack against Israel or other Jewish targets around the world. Secretary-General Ban said yesterday that the use of terms like \"dirty microbe\" and \"savage animal\" by President Ahmadinejad in reference to Israel was \"unacceptable.\" Earlier this week, Iran's Revolutionary Guards commander, Mohammad Ali Jafari, predicted the \"destruction of the cancerous existence of Israel,\" and the Iranian foreign minister, Manouchehr Mottaki, said Israel has no \"legitimacy\" in the region. Beyond possibly preparing the ground for retaliation for the killing of a Hezbollah leader, Imad Mughniyeh, according to Israeli officials, Iran's rhetorical escalation may be intended to divert attention from an upcoming report by the U.N. nuclear watchdog about Tehran's nuclear activity. The International Atomic Energy Agency's report, to be issued as early as today or tomorrow, is expected to be followed by the imposition of a new round of mild sanctions by the Security Council on Tehran's mullahs, as proposed by top council powers, including Iran allies Russia and China.What is interesting is that it is still unknown who might have carried out the assasination of the Hezb'allah terrorist leader Imad Mughniyeh. It may have even been a faction inside Hezb'allah itself which would mean that any attack against Israel or its citizens would use the death of Mughniyeh as simply an excuse. As for deflecting attention from Mohammed ElBaradei's report due out this weekend, if anything, it makes any ambiguity in the IAEA report less favorable to Iran as their eliminationist rhetoric directed at Israel worries the world community."],"thought_2":["Following the Israeli bombing of a military site in Syria (we still have no positive ID of what was at that site), there were many Syrian apologists who scoffed at the notion that North Korea would send any materials or nuclear engineers to Syria and help them develop a nuclear program.So sorry:North Korea admitted to sending engineers to military- related and other facilities in Syria during its recent talks with the United States over its nuclear program, diplomatic sources in New York said Friday. Pyongyang, however, denied its involvement in Syrian nuclear development, according to the sources.

First, he strongly conveyed the idea that liberal internationalism is not only compatible with an aggressive war on terror, it's an enormous boon to it. Indeed, the discussion of terror was more extensive than you might have expected.  This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it. This threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it. If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Amman; in London and Bali; in Washington and New York. If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope.  This is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in Afghanistan, and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets. No one welcomes war. I recognize the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan. But my country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO's first mission beyond Europe's borders is a success. For the people of Afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done. America cannot do this alone.  That last line carries a hint of a plea, and it's as clear a signal as you could want that Obama represents a complete break with the Bush administration's swaggering unilateralism.  Obama also tried to persuade us that we're on the cusp of a global moment as historic and momentous as the end of World War II and the fall of the Berlin Wall -- shoring up Obama's message that only the candidate who truly grasps the nature of our changing world is the one with real commander-in-chief readiness.  \t\t\tSixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again. History has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril. When you, the German people, tore down that wall -- a wall that divided East and West; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope - walls came tumbling down around the world. From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened. Markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity. While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history.  Obama then sketched out a general picture of this moment's defining challenges and the changes required to meet them:  This is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons...This is the moment when every nation in Europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday....This is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably...  This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East...this is the moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close...this is the moment when we must come together to save this planet...And this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world...  Now the world will watch and remember what we do here -- what we do with this moment.  The speech also endeavored to reconcile patriotism with self-criticism of America, which some Republicans are already trying to locate in his anti-war candidacy and indeed in this very trip abroad:  I know my country has not perfected itself. At times, we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people. We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.  But I also know how much I love America. I know that for more than two centuries, we have strived -- at great cost and great sacrifice -- to form a more perfect union; to seek, with other nations, a more hopeful world. Our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom -- indeed, every language is spoken in our country; every culture has left its imprint on ours; every point of view is expressed in our public squares. What has always united us -- what has always driven our people; what drew my father to America's shores -- is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people: that we can live free from fear and free from want; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please.   \"I know my country has not perfected itself.\" The line, again, has a hint of a plea; he's asking Europe to forgive America the sins of the Bush years, while insisting that there's nothing incompatible whatsoever between patriotic love of America and caring what the rest of the world thinks of us.   And really, this brings us right back to his candidacy. In a sense, the message of his very presence in Berlin is this: If slavery is the ultimate national sin, then the fact that he's running for president, and very well may win, and is promising the rest of the world a better America if he does win -- well, then all of this would achieve some sort of movement in the direction of that perfection that stubbornly continues to elude us."],"thought_2":["It's after the jump. Dig in. Video and more soon.  Late Update: Here's the vid...    \t\t\tThank you to the citizens of Berlin and to the people of Germany. Let me thank Chancellor Merkel and Foreign Minister Steinmeier for welcoming me earlier today. Thank you Mayor Wowereit, the Berlin Senate, the police, and most of all thank you for this welcome.     I come to Berlin as so many of my countrymen have come before.  Tonight, I speak to you not as a candidate for President, but as a citizen - a proud citizen of the United States, and a fellow citizen of the world.      I know that I don't look like the Americans who've previously spoken in this great city. The journey that led me here is improbable. My mother was born in the heartland of America, but my father grew up herding goats in Kenya. His father - my grandfather - was a cook, a domestic servant to the British.      At the height of the Cold War, my father decided, like so many others in the forgotten corners of the world, that his yearning - his dream - required the freedom and opportunity promised by the West. And so he wrote letter after letter to universities all across America until somebody, somewhere answered his prayer for a better life.     That is why I'm here. And you are here because you too know that yearning. This city, of all cities, knows the dream of freedom. And you know that the only reason we stand here tonight is because men and women from both of our nations came together to work, and struggle, and sacrifice for that better life.     Ours is a partnership that truly began sixty years ago this summer, on the day when the first American plane touched down at Templehof.     On that day, much of this continent still lay in ruin.  The rubble of this city had yet to be built into a wall. The Soviet shadow had swept across Eastern Europe, while in the West, America, Britain, and France took stock of their losses, and pondered how the world might be remade.      This is where the two sides met.  And on the twenty-fourth of June, 1948, the Communists chose to blockade the western part of the city.  They cut off food and supplies to more than two million Germans in an effort to extinguish the last flame of freedom in Berlin.     The size of our forces was no match for the much larger Soviet Army. And yet retreat would have allowed Communism to march across Europe. Where the last war had ended, another World War could have easily begun. All that stood in the way was Berlin.     And that's when the airlift began - when the largest and most unlikely rescue in history brought food and hope to the people of this city.      The odds were stacked against success.  In the winter, a heavy fog filled the sky above, and many planes were forced to turn back without dropping off the needed supplies. The streets where we stand were filled with hungry families who had no comfort from the cold.      But in the darkest hours, the people of Berlin kept the flame of hope burning. The people of Berlin refused to give up. And on one fall day, hundreds of thousands of Berliners came here, to the Tiergarten, and heard the city's mayor implore the world not to give up on freedom. \"There is only one possibility,\" he said.  \"For us to stand together united until this battle is won...The people of Berlin have spoken.  We have done our duty, and we will keep on doing our duty. People of the world: now do your duty...People of the world, look at Berlin!\"     People of the world - look at Berlin!     Look at Berlin, where Germans and Americans learned to work together and trust each other less than three years after facing each other on the field of battle.     Look at Berlin, where the determination of a people met the generosity of the Marshall Plan and created a German miracle; where a victory over tyranny gave rise to NATO, the greatest alliance ever formed to defend our common security.      Look at Berlin, where the bullet holes in the buildings and the somber stones and pillars near the Brandenburg Gate insist that we never forget our common humanity.      People of the world - look at Berlin, where a wall came down, a continent came together, and history proved that there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one.       Sixty years after the airlift, we are called upon again. History has led us to a new crossroad, with new promise and new peril. When you, the German people, tore down that wall - a wall that divided East and West; freedom and tyranny; fear and hope - walls came tumbling down around the world. From Kiev to Cape Town, prison camps were closed, and the doors of democracy were opened. Markets opened too, and the spread of information and technology reduced barriers to opportunity and prosperity. While the 20th century taught us that we share a common destiny, the 21st has revealed a world more intertwined than at any time in human history.     The fall of the Berlin Wall brought new hope. But that very closeness has given rise to new dangers - dangers that cannot be contained within the borders of a country or by the distance of an ocean.       The terrorists of September 11th plotted in Hamburg and trained in Kandahar and Karachi before killing thousands from all over the globe on American soil.       As we speak, cars in Boston and factories in Beijing are melting the ice caps in the Arctic, shrinking coastlines in the Atlantic, and bringing drought to farms from Kansas to Kenya.     Poorly secured nuclear material in the former Soviet Union, or secrets from a scientist in Pakistan could help build a bomb that detonates in Paris. The poppies in Afghanistan become the heroin in Berlin. The poverty and violence in Somalia breeds the terror of tomorrow. The genocide in Darfur shames the conscience of us all.     In this new world, such dangerous currents have swept along faster than our efforts to contain them. That is why we cannot afford to be divided. No one nation, no matter how large or powerful, can defeat such challenges alone.  None of us can deny these threats, or escape responsibility in meeting them. Yet, in the absence of Soviet tanks and a terrible wall, it has become easy to forget this truth. And if we're honest with each other, we know that sometimes, on both sides of the Atlantic, we have drifted apart, and forgotten our shared destiny.     In Europe, the view that America is part of what has gone wrong in our world, rather than a force to help make it right, has become all too common. In America, there are voices that deride and deny the importance of Europe's role in our security and our future. Both views miss the truth - that Europeans today are bearing new burdens and taking more responsibility in critical parts of the world; and that just as American bases built in the last century still help to defend the security of this continent, so does our country still sacrifice greatly for freedom around the globe.     Yes, there have been differences between America and Europe. No doubt, there will be differences in the future. But the burdens of global citizenship continue to bind us together. A change of leadership in Washington will not lift this burden. In this new century, Americans and Europeans alike will be required to do more - not less. Partnership and cooperation among nations is not a choice; it is the one way, the only way, to protect our common security and advance our common humanity.      That is why the greatest danger of all is to allow new walls to divide us from one another.  The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand.  The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand.  The walls between races and tribes; natives and immigrants; Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand.  These now are the walls we must tear down.      We know they have fallen before. After centuries of strife, the people of Europe have formed a Union of promise and prosperity. Here, at the base of a column built to mark victory in war, we meet in the center of a Europe at peace. Not only have walls come down in Berlin, but they have come down in Belfast, where Protestant and Catholic found a way to live together; in the Balkans, where our Atlantic alliance ended wars and brought savage war criminals to justice; and in South Africa, where the struggle of a courageous people defeated apartheid.     So history reminds us that walls can be torn down. But the task is never easy.  True partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice.  They require sharing the burdens of development and diplomacy; of progress and peace. They require allies who will listen to each other, learn from each other and, most of all, trust each other.      That is why America cannot turn inward.  That is why Europe cannot turn inward.  America has no better partner than Europe. Now is the time to build new bridges across the globe as strong as the one that bound us across the Atlantic.  Now is the time to join together, through constant cooperation, strong institutions, shared sacrifice, and a global commitment to progress, to meet the challenges of the 21st century. It was this spirit that led airlift planes to appear in the sky above our heads, and people to assemble where we stand today.  And this is the moment when our nations - and all nations - must summon that spirit anew.      This is the moment when we must defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it.  This threat is real and we cannot shrink from our responsibility to combat it. If we could create NATO to face down the Soviet Union, we can join in a new and global partnership to dismantle the networks that have struck in Madrid and Amman; in London and Bali; in Washington and New York.  If we could win a battle of ideas against the communists, we can stand with the vast majority of Muslims who reject the extremism that leads to hate instead of hope.     This is the moment when we must renew our resolve to rout the terrorists who threaten our security in Afghanistan, and the traffickers who sell drugs on your streets.  No one welcomes war. I recognize the enormous difficulties in Afghanistan.  But my country and yours have a stake in seeing that NATO's first mission beyond Europe's borders is a success. For the people of Afghanistan, and for our shared security, the work must be done.  America cannot do this alone.  The Afghan people need our troops and your troops; our support and your support to defeat the Taliban and al Qaeda, to develop their economy, and to help them rebuild their nation.  We have too much at stake to turn back now.      This is the moment when we must renew the goal of a world without nuclear weapons.  The two superpowers that faced each other across the wall of this city came too close too often to destroying all we have built and all that we love.  With that wall gone, we need not stand idly by and watch the further spread of the deadly atom. It is time to secure all loose nuclear materials; to stop the spread of nuclear weapons; and to reduce the arsenals from another era. This is the moment to begin the work of seeking the peace of a world without nuclear weapons.      This is the moment when every nation in Europe must have the chance to choose its own tomorrow free from the shadows of yesterday.  In this century, we need a strong European Union that deepens the security and prosperity of this continent, while extending a hand abroad.  In this century - in this city of all cities - we must reject the Cold War mind-set of the past, and resolve to work with Russia when we can, to stand up for our values when we must, and to seek a partnership that extends across this entire continent.     This is the moment when we must build on the wealth that open markets have created, and share its benefits more equitably.  Trade has been a cornerstone of our growth and global development.  But we will not be able to sustain this growth if it favors the few, and not the many.  Together, we must forge trade that truly rewards the work that creates wealth, with meaningful protections for our people and our planet.  This is the moment for trade that is free and fair for all.     This is the moment we must help answer the call for a new dawn in the Middle East. My country must stand with yours and with Europe in sending a direct message to Iran that it must abandon its nuclear ambitions. We must support the Lebanese who have marched and bled for democracy, and the Israelis and Palestinians who seek a secure and lasting peace. And despite past differences, this is the moment when the world should support the millions of Iraqis who seek to rebuild their lives, even as we pass responsibility to the Iraqi government and finally bring this war to a close.     This is the moment when we must come together to save this planet.  Let us resolve that we will not leave our children a world where the oceans rise and famine spreads and terrible storms devastate our lands.  Let us resolve that all nations - including my own - will act with the same seriousness of purpose as has your nation, and reduce the carbon we send into our atmosphere.  This is the moment to give our children back their future. This is the moment to stand as one.     And this is the moment when we must give hope to those left behind in a globalized world. We must remember that the Cold War born in this city was not a battle for land or treasure. Sixty years ago, the planes that flew over Berlin did not drop bombs; instead they delivered food, and coal, and candy to grateful children. And in that show of solidarity, those pilots won more than a military victory. They won hearts and minds; love and loyalty and trust - not just from the people in this city, but from all those who heard the story of what they did here.      Now the world will watch and remember what we do here - what we do with this moment.  Will we extend our hand to the people in the forgotten corners of this world who yearn for lives marked by dignity and opportunity; by security and justice? Will we lift the child in Bangladesh from poverty, shelter the refugee in Chad, and banish the scourge of AIDS in our time?      Will we stand for the human rights of the dissident in Burma, the blogger in Iran, or the voter in Zimbabwe?  Will we give meaning to the words \"never again\" in Darfur?      Will we acknowledge that there is no more powerful example than the one each of our nations projects to the world?  Will we reject torture and stand for the rule of law?  Will we welcome immigrants from different lands, and shun discrimination against those who don't look like us or worship like we do, and keep the promise of equality and opportunity for all of our people?     People of Berlin - people of the world - this is our moment.  This is our time.      I know my country has not perfected itself.  At times, we've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality for all of our people.  We've made our share of mistakes, and there are times when our actions around the world have not lived up to our best intentions.      But I also know how much I love America. I know that for more than two centuries, we have strived - at great cost and great sacrifice - to form a more perfect union; to seek, with other nations, a more hopeful world.  Our allegiance has never been to any particular tribe or kingdom - indeed, every language is spoken in our country; every culture has left its imprint on ours; every point of view is expressed in our public squares. What has always united us - what has always driven our people; what drew my father to America's shores - is a set of ideals that speak to aspirations shared by all people: that we can live free from fear and free from want; that we can speak our minds and assemble with whomever we choose and worship as we please.        These are the aspirations that joined the fates of all nations in this city. These aspirations are bigger than anything that drives us apart. It is because of these aspirations that the airlift began. It is because of these aspirations that all free people - everywhere - became citizens of Berlin. It is in pursuit of these aspirations that a new generation - our generation - must make our mark on the world.       People of Berlin - and people of the world - the scale of our challenge is great.  The road ahead will be long. But I come before you to say that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom. We are a people of improbable hope.  With an eye toward the future, with resolve in our hearts, let us remember this history, and answer our destiny, and remake the world once again."],"prob":["will, american, presid, america, nation, countri, polici"],"frex":["america, bolton, democraci, countri, must, centuri, achiev"],"lift":["-negoti, borah, granma, iranand, nazi-appeas, nunn-lugar, omv"],"score":["america, bush, presid, bolton, american, polici, world"],"proportion":["0.05"]}],"topic_no":[9,16]},{"name":["waterboard, mukasey, thinkfast, interrog, surveil, detaine, cia"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[5],"thought_1":["White House Press Corps Fails To Ask A Single Question On U.S. Attorney Investigation  \t\t\t\t\tToday, the Office of Public Responsibility and the Department of Justice Inspector General released the culmination of an 18-month investigation: a report finding that the firing process of the nine U.S. Attorneys was “fundamentally flawed” and in some cases, governed by politics. The investigation also found that former attorney general Alberto Gonzales, Justice Department aide Kyle Sampson, and other Justice officials made “inconsistent, misleading, and inaccurate” statements about their reasons for firing the attorneys.  The investigators also noted that its report was in many ways incomplete, due to the White House’s stonewalling:  [T]here are gaps in our investigation because of the refusal of certain key witnesses to be interviewed by us, including former White House officials Karl Rove, Harriet Miers, and William Kelley, former Department of Justice White House Liaison Monica Goodling, Senator Pete Domenici, and his Chief of Staff. In addition, the White House would not provide us internal documents related to the removals of the U.S. Attorneys. Today, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to continue the investigation into Gonzales and other officials “to determine whether any prosecutable offense” was committed in the attorney firings. Despite this action, the White House press corps made no mention of the investigation during the 40-minute briefing with spokesman Tony Fratto.  Reacting to the report today, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-VT) said the abuses documented in the report “are corrosive to the very foundations of our system of justice.” He also warned President Bush that “any misuse of the pardon power” to the benefit of administration officials involved will be seen “as an admission of wrongdoing and misuse of power.” Watch it:                  if (undefined===window.scriptAlreadyRequested) { window.scriptAlreadyRequested = false; } if (undefined===window.scriptAlreadyLoaded) { window.scriptAlreadyLoaded = false; } if (! scriptAlreadyRequested) { \tvar head = document.getElementsByTagName(\"head\")[0]; \tvar script = document.createElement(\"script\"); \tscript.setAttribute(\"type\", \"text/javascript\"); \tscript.setAttribute(\"src\", \"http://video.techprogress.org/scripts/player.js\"); \thead.appendChild(script); \tscriptAlreadyRequested = true; }\t function player683224246Function() { \tif (scriptAlreadyLoaded == true) \t{ \t\t\tclearInterval(player683224246Interval); \t\t\tif(DetectFlashVer(9,0,115))  \t\t\t{ \t\t\t\tAC_FL_RunContent( \t\t\t\t\t'codebase', 'http://download.macromedia.com/pub/shockwave/cabs/flash/swflash.cab#version=9,0,115,0', \t\t\t\t\t'width', '320', \t\t\t\t\t'height', '266', \t\t\t\t\t'src', 'player', \t\t\t\t\t'quality', 'high', \t\t\t\t\t'pluginspage', 'http://www.macromedia.com/go/getflashplayer', \t\t\t\t\t'align', 'middle', \t\t\t\t\t'play', 'true', \t\t\t\t\t'loop', 'true', \t\t\t\t\t'scale', 'noscale', \t\t\t\t\t'wmode', 'window', \t\t\t\t\t'devicefont', 'false', \t\t\t\t\t'id', 'object_player683224246', \t\t\t\t\t'bgcolor', '#000000', \t\t\t\t\t'name', 'player', \t\t\t\t\t'menu', 'true', \t\t\t\t\t'allowScriptAccess','always', \t\t\t\t\t'allowFullScreen','true', \t\t\t\t\t'movie', 'http://video.techprogress.org/player', \t\t\t\t\t'salign', 'tl', \t\t\t\t\t'flashvars', 'postWidth=320&amp;postHeight=240&amp;id=player683224246&amp;title=&amp;skin=http://video.techprogress.org/skins/think_progress.xml&amp;video=http://video.thinkprogress.org/2008/09/leahy-gonzales.flv&amp;link=PERMALINK', 'divid', 'player683224246' \t\t\t\t\t); \t\t\t} \t} } var player683224246Interval = setInterval(player683224246Function, Math.round(Math.random() * 100) + 100);"],"thought_2":["Mayer: Cheney ‘Repeatedly’ Held ‘Highly Unusual’ Meetings With CIA IG Before Torture Probe Stopped  \t\t\t\t\tIn the spring of 2004, then-CIA Inspector General John Helgerson issued a classified report warning “that interrogation procedures approved by the C.I.A. after the Sept. 11 attacks might violate some provisions of the international Convention Against Torture.” Helgerson’s report “also raised concern about whether the use of the techniques could expose agency officers to legal liability.” In an interview today, Harper’s Scott Horton asks investigative journalist Jane Mayer about the revelation in her new book that “Helgerson was summoned repeatedly to meet privately with Vice President Cheney” before his investigation was “stopped in its tracks.” Mayer said that Cheney’s interaction with Helgerson was “highly unusual“: MAYER:Asked for comment, Helgerson through the CIA spokesman denied he felt pressured in any way by Cheney. But others I interviewed have described the IG’s office to me as extremely politicized. They have also suggested it was very unusual that the Vice President interjected himself into the work of the IG. Fred Hitz, who had the same post in previous administrations, told me that no vice president had ever met with him. He thought it highly unusual. According to Mayer, Helgerson’s report is said to be “very disturbing, the size of two Manhattan phone books, and full of terrible descriptions of mistreatment.” Mayer added that Cheney’s interest in Helgerson proves that as early as 2004 “the Vice President’s office was fully aware that there were allegations of serious wrongdoing in The Program.” In October 2007, CIA Director Gen. Michael Hayden “ordered an unusual internal inquiry” into Helgerson’s office, focusing on complaints that Helgerson was on “a crusade against those who have participated in controversial detention programs.”"],"prob":["bush, presid, administr, hous, said, white, tortur"],"frex":["waterboard, mukasey, thinkfast, interrog, surveil, detaine, cia"],"lift":["-attorney, addington, al-qahtani, allr, anti-waterboard, arraign, ausa"],"score":["tortur, bush, perino, detaine, cia, waterboard, interrog"],"proportion":["0.05"]},{"name":["forc, war, will, troop, militari, iraqi, iraq"],"children":[{"name":["maliki, sadr, timet, basra, mahdi, al-maliki, iraqi"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[11],"thought_1":["The fighting that has erupted in Basra should come as no surprise to anyone who has followed the course of the war in Iraq.  While the US has spent the last year increasing force size in western Iraq and more aggressively challenging militias in Baghdad, the British have become more passive in Basra and have significantly reduced their footprint to one-tenth of their original commitment.  That has made them almost invisible in the south, and since the Iraqi Army did not have a large enough presence there either, the British reduction allowed competing Shi’ite militias to take control of the area.Now that the Iraqi government has enough troops, they have tried to make their writ run in Basra — and as the Times of London notes, that highlights the failure of the British in that area:The British took the wrong tack in the south, and the results have been plain for at least two years.  Instead of remaining in control of Basra and keeping order until Iraq could build their new security forces, their reduced footprint created a vacuum for order that the militias were only too happy to fill.  The Sadr Mahdi Army and the Badr Brigades started seizing control of the streets in 2004, when the British reduced their forces to 8600 troops, and they have only strengthened their grip while the British retreated further.  The Washington Post noted the problem last summer, as the surge began showing signs of ending the sectarian strife everywhere else.The fighting in Basra now was inevitable at some point.  Baghdad couldn’t allow a major city like Basra to operate outside its control forever.  Instead of an orderly transition from Coalition to Iraqi security control, as is happening in the West, the Maliki government now has to take Basra by force — while the rump of British power sits in its bases, unable to contribute at all to security any longer.  Whether Maliki decided to do this next week or next year, the fight in Basra had to happen at some point in order to apply the rule of law throughout Iraq.That’s why this isn’t a collapse of the American surge, but a demonstration of the folly of premature withdrawal.  The lack of fortitude on Iraq left a vacuum that created bigger problems and more serious fighting than tenacity did.  Had we listened to the war’s critics in 2005 and 2006, gangsters would have swallowed the entirety of Iraq, and we would have a second Somalia in southwest Asia."],"thought_2":["Iraqi soldiers, without American assistance, are about to take on the worst of the worst in Iraq; the Mahdi Army in their Sadr City stronghold:Hundreds of Iraqi soldiers entered the volatile Sadr City district of eastern Baghdad on Tuesday, meeting virtually no resistance from the Shiite militia fighters who in recent weeks have clashed heavily with U.S. and Iraqi troops, Iraqi officials said. The deployment of hundreds of government troops to the area began before dawn. It was the start of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's long-awaited effort to restore order in the vast Shiite slum, home to scores of militiamen loyal to radical anti-American cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. The push, dubbed \"Operation Peace,\" was \"totally Iraqi planned, led and executed,\" the U.S. military said in a statement. There were no reports of clashes during the first day of the operation, which began just over a week after political leaders influential in Sadr City reached a cease-fire agreement with lawmakers of Maliki's party.As you can see, this is a very significant development. If the Iraqi Army can prove itself in that hellhole, it would show that they have made significant strides toward being able to stand on their own against a well armed enemy.The fact that this operation is taking place at all is a sign of political progress as well. Prime Minister Maliki appears to have finally gained a little confidence and is doing what must be done to get his own house in order.The next review by General Petreaus is in July. It wouldn't surprise me if the General has more cautious words of progress toward the goal of bring more American troops home."],"prob":["iraq, iraqi, troop, war, forc, withdraw, will"],"frex":["maliki, sadr, timet, basra, mahdi, al-maliki, iraqi"],"lift":["al-hakim, al-obeidi, amara, basra, drawdown, falluja, footwear"],"score":["iraqi, iraq, maliki, sadr, troop, basra, mahdi"],"proportion":["0.03"]},{"name":["afghanistan, taliban, musharraf, afghan, laden, pakistani, bhutto"],"size":[1800],"topic_no":[13],"thought_1":["Thanks to our good friends in the Pakistani government, several hundred Taliban fighters have inflitrated across the border from their bases in the northwest frontier provinces and are seizing villages on the outskirts of Kandahar:The Afghan Army flew four planeloads of soldiers to Kandahar from the capital, Kabul, on Tuesday. Canadian forces have also moved in to the region.\"When we get permission from commanders, we will attack the Taliban,\" Mohammad said.Aircraft from the NATO-led security force dropped leaflets in the Arghandab area, telling residents that 700 Afghan troops were coming to force out the Taliban and warning residents to say indoors in case fighting breaks out, said a spokesman, Mark Laity.The Taliban assault Monday on the outskirts of Kandahar was the latest display of strength by the militants despite a record number of U.S. and NATO troops in the country.The push into the Arghandab district, a lush region filled with grape and pomegranate groves that the Soviets could never conquer, came three days after a coordinated Taliban attack on a Kandahar prison that freed several hundred insurgent fighters.To the Canucks, this is a broken record. Several times in the last few years they have swept the Taliban from the area surrounding Kandahar only to see more of the enemy infiltrate across the virtually non-existent border with Pakistan and re-occupy the same ground. It is driving the Canadian government to distraction that NATO can't send more troops to help their boys hold this vital area. However, the Afghan army has performed well in the past - under Canadian leadership - so expect a similar scenario to develop here. The Candadians and Afghans will engage the Taliban and, after a few days of intense fighting, send them flying back across the border considerably diminished in numbers.The fact that NATO can't spare a couple of hundred combat soldiers to give the Canadians a hand is one of the real disappointments of the war. And it's not going to change anytime soon."],"thought_2":["This could be a very big deal or it could just have been a mistake but the Pakistani army - our erstwhile ally - are very upset over reports a US-led coalition airstrike along the Pakistani-Afghan border killed 11 Pak soldiers:The U.S.-led coalition said it used artillery and aerial drones against attackers who opened fire on forces operating inside Afghanistan. It said coalition forces did not enter Pakistan.The incident late Tuesday followed a reported clash between Afghan forces and coalition forces and Taliban militants in the same area. The Taliban said eight of its fighters died in the skirmish.The Pakistani army said the coalition airstrike hit a post of the paramilitary Frontier Corps and was a \"completely unprovoked and cowardly act\" that \"hit at the very basis of cooperation\" in the war on terrorism.It launched a strong protest and reserved \"the right to protect our citizens and soldiers against aggression,\" the military said in a statement. The statement said the clash in the Mohmand tribal region \"had hit at the very basis of cooperation\" between the allies in the war on terror.Since those \"Frontier Corps\" do little or nothing to stop Taliban infiltration of Afhganistan, the idea that the attack hit \"at the very basis of cooperation\" in the war on terror is silly. It is a clear signal by the US that the new policy of the Pakistani government of talking peace with the Taliban while turning the other way as they infiltrate Afghanistan is simply not acceptable. Were the Pakistani troops assisting the Taliban? It is not impossible that this was the case. There are factions in the army who would love to see the Taliban back in power in Afghanistan so it is not out of the question that the dead Pak troops were in cahoots with the extremists.But we will probably apologize for the \"mistake\" and promise that it will never happen again. Meanwhile, the problems along the border continue to worsen as the Pakistani army is apparently doing even less than before in trying to stop the infiltrators."],"prob":["militari, war, afghanistan, attack, terrorist, pakistan, veteran"],"frex":["afghanistan, taliban, musharraf, afghan, laden, pakistani, bhutto"],"lift":["-volunt, afghan-pakistan, afghanistansen, ahmadi, al-iraqi, ampute, anbari"],"score":["afghanistan, pakistan, taliban, musharraf, militari, pakistani, qaeda"],"proportion":["0.03"]}],"topic_no":[11,13]}],"topic_no":[2,18,14,7,8,17,3,12,4,20,6,15,10,1,19,9,16,5,11,13],"name":["STM Model"],"this_root":[true],"summary":["A topic model with 20 topics, 13246 documents and a 33763 word dictionary."],"proportions":[0.0404,0.0306,0.0571,0.0735,0.0498,0.0669,0.0658,0.0266,0.044,0.0321,0.0349,0.1019,0.0329,0.0408,0.035,0.0546,0.0574,0.0393,0.0476,0.0688]}
